Discussion Questions  
1. Why do we listen for data and end events when handling POST?  - POST requests can contain large amounts of data - Data is received in chunks to prevent memory overload - The 'data' event fires multiple times as chunks arrive - The 'end' event signals that all data has been received - This streaming approach is more efficient than waiting for all data at once 
2. What would happen if we didnâ€™t buffer the body correctly?  - We might get incomplete or corrupted data - Large requests could cause memory issues - The data might be processed before it's fully received - We could miss parts of the submission - The server might crash on large POST requests 
3. What is the format of form submissions when using the default browser form POST? - Default format is 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' - Data is sent as key-value pairs: name=value&name2=value2 - Special characters are URL encoded (spaces become +, special chars become %XX) - Each field is separated by & symbol - Values are encoded to ensure safe transmission 
4. Why do we use fs.appendFile instead of fs.writeFile? - fs.appendFile adds content to the end of the file - fs.writeFile would overwrite the entire file - Appending preserves previous submissions - Multiple submissions can be stored - Better for logging and maintaining history  
5. How could this be improved or made more secure? - Input validation and sanitization - Rate limiting to prevent spam - CSRF protection tokens - Use HTTPS for secure data transmission - Implement proper error handling - Add request size limits - Use a proper database instead of a text file - Add logging and monitoring - Implement user authentication
